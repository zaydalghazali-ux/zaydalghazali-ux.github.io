            <p class="hero-text">I run usability tests to find where interfaces fail users, then redesign them based on what I learned. Most recently, I've been testing touchscreen kiosks and mobile apps to understand how people interact with physical interfaces—tapping, swiping, and navigating while distracted or wearing gloves. I benchmark designs against competitors, build prototypes in Figma, and validate solutions through structured user testing.</p>

                    <p>A public touchscreen wayfinding system had a 0% task success rate. I ran usability tests with 3 participants to figure out why—turns out the display looked static (no one realized they could interact with it), touch sensitivity was terrible, and there were zero accessibility features. I redesigned the idle state, built a 7-toggle accessibility menu based on WCAG standards, and added progressive disclosure wayfinding inspired by a competitor's system.</p>

                    <p>MSU students were juggling 5+ separate campus apps just to check dining hours, find parking, and access safety features. Through interviews with 8 students, I found that 68% abandoned tasks because they couldn't figure out which app had what they needed. I redesigned the information architecture around how students actually think about their tasks—not how IT departments organize systems—and made safety features accessible from any screen instead of buried in a separate app.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>I'm a UX Researcher at the University of Michigan, and I spend most of my time figuring out why interfaces don't work and how to fix them. I run usability tests, watch people struggle with designs, and then redesign based on what I learned.</p>
            
            <p>Right now I'm focused on physical interaction design—touchscreens, mobile apps, anything people use with their hands. I'm interested in how context changes everything: a button that works great at a desk might be impossible to hit while walking, wearing gloves, or sitting in a moving car.</p>
