        <div class="container-narrow">
            <h2>The Outcome</h2>
            
            <p>I redesigned an interactive library kiosk with a 0% wayfinding success rate. Through usability testing and competitive analysis, I identified critical failures in touchscreen affordance, physical interaction, and accessibility—challenges applicable across automotive, medical, and public touchscreen systems.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The core problem:</strong> Students couldn't navigate to rooms because the display looked static (poor affordance), touch sensitivity required multiple taps, and zero accessibility features existed despite ADA requirements for public facilities.</p>

            <h2>Research & Methods</h2>
            
            <h3>Moderated Usability Testing</h3>
            
            <p>Recruited 3 participants representing diverse library users. Used think-aloud protocol with 3 standardized tasks:</p>
            
            <ul class="clean-list">
                <li>Find the next MSU event</li>
                <li>Find a librarian's email address</li>
                <li>Navigate to the Red Cedar Instruction Room</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 style="margin-top: 32px;">Competitive Analysis</h3>
            
            <p>Benchmarked against Broad College of Business and Law Building displays. Broad's system achieved significantly higher task completion through visual wayfinding (floor maps + "you are here" + turn-by-turn directions).</p>
            
            <h3 style="margin-top: 32px;">Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
            
            <p>Systematic review against Nielsen's usability principles and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. Identified 7 critical violations affecting discoverability, feedback, and universal access.</p>

                <p class="insight-text">"I had no idea the screen was interactive—I thought it was just displaying library hours."</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>Users walked past without realizing they could interact. The fundamental problem: <strong>poor affordance</strong>. The display looked static—no visual cues, no motion, no prompts, no clear call-to-action.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Second critical finding:</strong> Even when users did interact, maps showed room locations but provided no guidance on how to get there. All 3 participants expressed confusion about spatial terms like "West Wing, 2nd Floor" and couldn't translate map positions into physical navigation.</p>
            
            <div class="insight-box" style="margin-top: 32px;">

            <div class="solution-block">
                <h3><span class="solution-num">1</span>Fixed Affordance Problem</h3>
                
                <p>Redesigned idle state with prominent "TOUCH SCREEN TO BEGIN" prompt using high-contrast typography and MSU branding. Made the accessibility icon permanently visible in the top-right corner.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Design rationale:</strong> Static text outperforms motion graphics for accessibility—motion can trigger vestibular disorders and would be distracting in quiet library environment.</p>
                
                <div class="hmi-connection">
                    <strong>Similar patterns in:</strong> Automotive "touch to wake" displays (Mercedes MBUX, BMW iDrive), medical device standby modes, industrial control panels. All balance visibility with distraction prevention.

                <p>Added 7 configurable accessibility options based on WCAG 2.1 AA requirements:</p>
                
                <ul class="solution-list">
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> High contrast mode for low vision users</li>
                    <li><strong>Plain English:</strong> Simplified language for cognitive accessibility</li>
                    <li><strong>Keyboard-only:</strong> Navigate without touch (motor disabilities)</li>
                    <li><strong>Logic & Headers:</strong> Semantic structure for screen readers</li>
                    <li><strong>LARGE:</strong> Increased font size (18pt → 24pt)</li>
                    <li><strong>Image + alt:</strong> Alt text for all visual elements</li>
                    <li><strong>Fonts:</strong> Accessible typefaces (OpenDyslexic option)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Plus icon-based navigation preferences for audio, cognitive, and sound-based wayfinding.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Why these 7?</strong> Based on MSU disability services data showing most-requested accommodations. Each toggle enables/disables specific WCAG success criteria.</p>
                
                <div class="hmi-connection">
                    <strong>Broader application:</strong> Automotive displays increasingly offer similar customization (Honda Accord's configurable contrast, Tesla's accessibility modes). Medical devices require multimodal input for diverse patient needs. Industrial systems need glove-friendly interfaces with audio feedback.

                <p>Inspired by Broad College's successful system. Four-step progression:</p>
                
                <ul class="solution-list">
                    <li>Show floor overview map first (spatial context)</li>

                    <li>Display "YOU ARE HERE" indicator with directional arrows</li>
                    <li>Provide turn-by-turn text instructions</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Design principle:</strong> Users need both spatial context (map view) and step-by-step guidance (directions). Mirrors modern automotive navigation UX—early GPS showed only maps; modern systems combine map + turn-by-turn + voice + lane guidance.</p>

                <p>Consolidated duplicate features (Maps vs. Find a Location vs. Directions) into task-based categories: Conference Rooms, Study Rooms, Restrooms, Elevators, Departments.</p>
                
                <p>Added search/filter: "Filter by Name, Floor, Room #, Type of Classroom"</p>
                
                <p><strong>Why task-based?</strong> Users think in goals ("find a study room"), not system features ("check Maps tab vs. Find a Location tab"). Reduces cognitive load and navigation time.</p>

                <p><strong>The learning:</strong> In professional HMI work, validation isn't optional—it's the primary deliverable.
